libpythonexamples
==================

This is a collection of simple examples on how to use python libraries (or modules or whatever else you would like to call it).

YAML
-----

This is a humanreadable and writable data format.

csv
------

csv files or comma-separated-values files are widely used to store data in table formats.

It is much simpler, more portable and distribution friendly than, say, a MySql database. Relational databases are on the other hand much, much better at handling multiple tables, searching and such.

E.g. they may be easily imported into most spreadsheets. Also, they may be tab, semicolon, or using other delimiters. Header row is optional.
